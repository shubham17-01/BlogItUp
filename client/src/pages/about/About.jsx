            BlogItUp was created by Mayank Chopra, Ebrahim Malkapurwala and Shubham prabhu
            as out project for the subject MERN Stack for the year 2021/22. It is our project for our Sem 6
            in third year of engineering. We were able to learn a lot of concepts through this project and 
            faced quite a lot of challenges too. In the end we were able to successfully complete the project 
            but a few of our goals were left unaccomplished. We hope you enjoyed your experience in using BlogitUp
